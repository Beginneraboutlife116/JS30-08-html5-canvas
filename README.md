## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- a11y-dialog

### What I learned

Although this canvas game idea was from a [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ), made by [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisCourses), I  still learned how to use html5 canvas and how to change the frame to make characters or view switching.

There are lots of method and properties could be used:
- `Window.requestAnimationFrame()`
- `CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawImage()`

In this practice, except the keyboard decorations, all of the things showing on the canvas are made by canvas methods.
- Like character life value.
- The got damage animation.
- The clock, and counting.

### Continued development

I would try to make a fighting game by myself, and the topic would may be alpaca, because I could use [this idea](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/alpaca-image-generator-website-ce2oc0eus8) to make choosing character view.

And also it will be a SPA created by React, I believed.

There are few features, like:
1. User could change the keyboard setting, it means that would have a setting page.
2. User could choose the favorite alpaca character, and even save it, it means that I need to record the use info to maintain the character style.
